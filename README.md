# request-http-cache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/request-http-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gitterHQ/request-http-cache) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gitterHQ/request-http-cache/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/gitterHQ/request-http-cache)

A [request](https://github.com/request/request) "middleware" for caching HTTP responses in-memory or in Redis. Built for
Gitter's communications with GitHub as part of [Tentacles](https://github.com/gitterHQ/tentacles),
although it's intended as a general purpose HTTP caching module that should work
with any request HTTP client.

```
npm install request-http-cache
```

## About

This module is intended for use with [request-extensible](https://github.com/suprememoocow/request-extensible).

It is designed to honor the HTTP caching semantics used by the GitHub API and use
Conditional Requests, using ETags, for stale responses while correctly handling Vary headers.

## Using

### Using with an in-memory Backend

```javascript
var requestExt = require('request-extensible');
var RequestHttpCache = require('request-http-cache');

var httpRequestCache = new RequestHttpCache({
  max: 1024*1024 // Maximum cache size (1mb) defaults to 512Kb
});

var request = requestExt({
  extensions: [
    httpRequestCache.extension
  ]
});

// Now use request as you would request/request
request({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users/suprememoocow' }, function(err, response, body) {

});
```

### Using with a Redis Backend

When using with a Redis backend, it's highly recommended to use `maxmemory` and
`maxmemory-policy` configurations to ensure that the Redis memory usage doesn't
grow out of control.

```javascript
var requestExt = require('request-extensible');
var RequestHttpCache = require('request-http-cache');

var httpRequestCache = new RequestHttpCache({
  backend: 'redis',
  redis: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 6379
  },
  redisClient: redisClient, // Or you can pass in your Redis client
  ttl: 86400                // Maximum cached response time
});

var request = requestExt({
  extensions: [
    httpRequestCache.extension
  ]
});

// Now use request as you would request/request
request({ url: 'https://api.github.com/users/suprememoocow' }, function(err, response, body) {

});
```

# Under the Hood

When a new outgoing request is made, the Vary headers for the URL endpoint are
looked up in the cache.

### Outgoing

 * If the Vary headers for the endpoint are not known (ie, the URL has not been cached),
   the request proceeds as normal.
 * If the Vary headers are available, a SHA1 hash of the URL plus the requested headers
   specified by the Vary is generated. Although the chance of a hash entry collision is rare,
   the library does deal with this situation and treats it as a cache miss.
 * The Etag and Expiry headers for the previous cached response are looked up using the
   hash.
 * If the response has not yet expired, it is returned immediately.
 * If the response has expired, the request is issued with a `If-None-Match` header

### Incoming
 * If the response is in error or a 500 status code, the cached response is used.
 * If the response is a 304, indicating that the data is still fresh, the cached response is used
 * Otherwise the response is cached and the Vary headers for the URL endpoint are stored
   the response is returned to the caller.  

# TODO

 * Support for `If-Modified-Since` conditional responses (currently only uses ETags)
 * Better handling of `Cache-Control` headers
 * Better handling of `Expires` headers (currently only uses `Cache-Control`'s `max-age`)

Pull requests welcome.
